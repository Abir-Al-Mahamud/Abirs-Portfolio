## Abir's Portfolio Website

I am a software engineer with an eagerness to learn. My main project at the moment has to deal with React, Ruby on Rails as well as HTML & CSS which is being used towards an event app which allows for people around the world to create and join events. Recently, I was involved in a group project which involved building a website utilizing the MERN stack to build a website for grilling events.

On a personal note, I am someone who enjoys playing and watching basketball (no particular team, I just enjoy good and competitive basketball). I also enjoy the training regimen of martial arts including Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as well as boxing.

Additional Skills: Ruby - JavaScript - SQL - HTML5 - CSS3 - Webpack - Chrome Extensions

When it comes to working on a team, I find it extremely important to be aware of everyone's emotions and background. I am very careful when it comes to saying words that may offend someone.
I love to learn and grow with others and enjoy helping people.

As a full-stack developer, I have enjoyed using Ruby, JavaScript, React/Redux, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, CSS, and HTML in my projects. Currently, I am self-learning Node.js, Express, and Python. I am always willing to learn much more!
